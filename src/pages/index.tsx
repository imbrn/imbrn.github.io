      <h1>Hi, I’m Bruno, a software engineer.</h1>
      <p>
        Currently, I’m working at Banco next and on open-source projects. I’ve
        created v8n, a fluent javascript validation library. I’m also an
        aspiring blog writter. And sometimes I write my thoughts on Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate by software engineering good practices, patterns,
        principles, and I struggle to learn all about it and to share with
        everyone around me.
      </p>
    </BasicLayout>
